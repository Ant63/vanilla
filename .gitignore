# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Drupal projects.
# Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its deployment processes, you
# may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.
#
# To ignore all paths that composer manages when using this project template,
# remove all double-hashed () lines.

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
